# Fitness Step Test

Swiftly thrown together in less than 24 hours for [Lincoln Hack](https://2019.lincolnhack.org/).

A quick overview:

This is cardiovascular fitness test that requires a 12" step, a Blue-tooth heart-rate monitor,
a browser with the Blue-tooth API, and 4 minutes of your time. The basic premise of the test is
thatyou're asked to step up and down from the step at a tempo of 96 bpm (the app provides a
metronome) for 3 minutes, once the 3 minutes is up, you immediately sit down and rest for 1
minute. You're heart-rate after this minute provides an insight into your fitness level.

This may not be scientifically accurate.
